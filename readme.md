# EZImgHost - Intro to Web Programming and Web Development Final Project
## Introduction
EZImgHost is a local image host prototype developed for Intro to Web Programming and Web Development (CS146) at Stevens Institute of Technology. 
EZImgHost was developed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. EZImgHost is not deployable, as no server functionality was required for the project. EZImgHost, rather, serves as a proof of concept for design and basic frontend skills.
## Getting Started
To try EZImgHost, simply open "index.html" in the "Team 8" folder. This will take you to the landing page. From here, you can test the basic functionality, such as page navigation, static styling, and dynamic elements from clientside JavaScript.
